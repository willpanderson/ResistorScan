# ResistorScan
A machine-learning Android application to help facilitate the identification of resistor values using image reconigtion. 

Resistor Scan uses the IEC 60063:2015 standard to classify images for the marking and coding of resistors with their respective capacitance or resistance values as described in IEC 60062. Resistor Scan uses the E24 series of resistors as this is most common in modern electronics.
